At some points the camera starts to shake up and down
- Possible reasons 
	o Odd camera configurations like min/max cam height distance to big/small)
	o Player positioning with the foot ray floor handler thing
inaccurate collision solids (sometimes the player model is in the ground sometimes floating above)
- Reason
	o To less time to justify just any collision solid to make it look good
